    <p>I am very interested in coding.I had completed<strong>"Python for everybody "</strong> from coursera.My final year project was based on electric watt hour meter.We modified the electric watt hour meter .Our device named <em>Rupeeya meter</em>is simply an electric watt hour meter that calculates the cost of current according to the amount of electricity consumed. </p>
